# Revit Plugin - AKP TOOLS -
My First Revit Plugin Using C#

After working with Dynamo & Python for about a year, the next logical step is to create a revit addon so I 
started converting my Dynamo nodes & Python scripts to c# as a revit Add-on for revit 2019.

Current planned features(2019):

-Check for overriden dimensions in view
-Check for duplicate Tags
-Check for untagged elements
-Rebar visibilty control
-Get spot coordinate of elements
-Go to Website (My Linkedin Profile)
-Installer for addin
-Addin info

Currently implementd features:

-UI buttons
-info

How to install:

-Copy the Addin file to Program Data>Autodesk>Revit>2019

-Copy the DLL File to your desired location and replace the second line in the Addin file with the location.
